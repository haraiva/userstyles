Scratch is a userstyle that turns the [itch.io](https://itch.io/) dashboard into a compact grid layout for your many projects. It allows for easier navigation, especially if you have a lot of projects and want a more compact view for them.

## Latest version: [v1.1.0](https://github.com/haraiva/userstyles/releases/tag/scratch-v1.1.0)

## Features:
- Choose between 2, 3 and 4-column grid layouts!
- Adjust the gutter between your project cells!
- Hide (or not!) the 'project owner' field under project titles! This is recommended for the compact 3-column grid view.
- Move the 'Create new project' to the top of the project list for easier access!
- Filter projects by publish status! Useful if you only want to see your drafts, for example. 

## Installation
With Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)):

1. After installing the browser extension, simply go to [Scratch's userstyles.world page](https://userstyles.world/style/20749/scratch-dashboard-grid-view-for-itch-io) and click "Install".
2. Tweak the options using the UserCSS configuration menu that you can open with the gear (⚙️) icon on the right side of the userstyle's name.
3. Have fun!

If you have other ways of installing userstyles I'm assuming you know what you're doing and don't need a guide. Feel free to modify the CSS as you wish!
