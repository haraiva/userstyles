A compact grid layout for your many projects on the [itch.io](https://itch.io/) dashboard. For easier navigation on the itch.io project dashboard, especially if you have a lot of projects and want a more compact view for them.

Features include:
- Choose between 2, 3 and 4-column grid layouts!
- Adjust the gutter between your project cells!
- Hide (or not!) the 'project owner' field under project titles! This is recommended for the compact 3-column grid view.
- Move the 'Create new project' to the top of the project list for easier access!
