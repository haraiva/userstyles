Scratch is a userstyle that turns the [itch.io](https://itch.io/) dashboard into a compact grid layout for your many projects. It allows for easier navigation, especially if you have a lot of projects and want a more compact view for them.

## Latest version: [v1.1.0](https://github.com/haraiva/userstyles/releases/tag/scratch-v1.1.0)

## Features:
- Choose between 2, 3 and 4-column grid layouts!
- Adjust the gutter between your project cells!
- Hide (or not!) the 'project owner' field under project titles! This is recommended for the compact 3-column grid view.
- Move the 'Create new project' to the top of the project list for easier access!
- Filter projects by publish status! Useful if you only want to see your drafts, for example.
