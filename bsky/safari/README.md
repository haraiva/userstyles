# Firmament - Safari/Userscript version

The Safari/Userscripts version of Firmament contains two separate files:
- `firmament.safari.user.css`: this is the file you need to install onto Userscripts!
- `firmament.themes.user.css`: an optional extra file if you want to use one of my pre-made themes.

## Customising Firmament for Userscript

To customise Firmament, you can change the values in the `:root` at the top of the `firmament.safari.user.css` file. Refer to the comments above each variable to see what values they accept.

To use a pre-made theme, install `firmament.themes.user.css` and uncomment whichever theme/colour-scheme you want to use. Note that the themes also override the custom header title.
